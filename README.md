# Esports-Manager
Well this file is just for me to learn how to use github, I guess.

Writing my own engine in c++, using SDL. No idea what else yet, that's as far as I've gotten.
I intend to write, in this order:

    player class
        player generation functions -> requires a name, ethnicity, nationality library to generate
        player history recording
        player salary demands, based on performance, reputation, and ability
    define games to be played
        establish attributes needed for each game
        establish ability costs for each attribute
        establish estimated salaries for each game by ability and reputation
    hash out some kind of simulation for each game
        establish how performance ratings for each role will be determined
        probably will develop other people type here (commentators, media, coaches, other staff)
    determine how the day to day sim will work
        some basic ai so you have people to compete against
